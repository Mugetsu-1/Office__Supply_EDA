# Office Supply Data Analysis

---

### Purpose
This repository contains a **practice project** created for building and showcasing skills in **Data Analysis (DA)** and **Data Science (DS)**. It is intended for learning and portfolio development on GitHub.

---

### Project Description
The project performs data analysis on an office supply dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The focus is on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain practical experience with real-world-style data.

---

### Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data manipulation with Pandas  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib  
- Insight interpretation  

---

### Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---


---

### Dataset
The dataset is used strictly for **practice and learning purposes** and represents office supply–related information such as categories, quantities, and costs.

---

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies:
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3. Open the notebook:
- jupyter notebook OfficeSupply.ipynb

4. Run all cells sequentially  

---

### Learning Outcome
This project strengthens foundational concepts in data analysis and data science, including working with datasets, performing EDA, and communicating insights visually.


### Results and Findings

The dataset was successfully cleaned by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing inconsistencies to ensure reliable analysis.

Revenue analysis showed that a small subset of products contributes a large portion of total revenue, indicating an uneven revenue distribution across product categories.

Regional analysis revealed noticeable differences in sales performance between regions, with certain regions consistently generating higher revenue than others.

Product-level analysis identified top-performing products as well as low-performing items, highlighting opportunities for inventory optimization and strategic focus.

Price distribution analysis showed variation in product pricing, with most products concentrated within a moderate price range and fewer high-priced outliers.

Time-based analysis (monthly trends) indicated seasonality in sales, with identifiable peak and off-peak periods throughout the year.

Correlation analysis demonstrated relationships between numerical features such as quantity sold, revenue, and price, helping understand which factors most influence sales performance.

Pareto analysis (80/20 rule) confirmed that approximately 20% of products account for around 80% of total revenue, reinforcing the importance of focusing on high-impact products.

Sales representative analysis showed performance variation among sales reps, suggesting differences in regional demand, product focus, or sales efficiency.

### Overall Insight

The EDA highlights clear patterns in revenue concentration, regional performance, and seasonality. The results emphasize the importance of data-driven decision-making for product prioritization, regional strategy, and sales planning. This project demonstrates practical application of EDA techniques for extracting meaningful insights from business-oriented datasets.
