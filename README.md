# Office Supply Data Analysis

---

### Purpose
This repository contains a **practice project** created for building and showcasing skills in **Data Analysis (DA)** and **Data Science (DS)**. It is intended for learning and portfolio development on GitHub.

---

### Project Description
The project performs data analysis on an office supply dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The focus is on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to gain practical experience with real-world-style data.

---

### Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data manipulation with Pandas  
- Data visualization with Matplotlib  
- Insight interpretation  

---

### Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---


---

### Dataset
The dataset is used strictly for **practice and learning purposes** and represents office supply–related information such as categories, quantities, and costs.

---

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install dependencies:
- pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
3. Open the notebook:
- jupyter notebook OfficeSupply.ipynb

4. Run all cells sequentially  

---

### Learning Outcome
This project strengthens foundational concepts in data analysis and data science, including working with datasets, performing EDA, and communicating insights visually.
